<a id="How-the-Query-System-Works"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">4.4.2</span><span class="sectitle">How the Query System Works</span></h4>

<p>In section <a href="4_002e4_002e4.xhtml#g_t4_002e4_002e4">4.4.4</a> we will present an implementation of the query
interpreter as a collection of procedures.  In this section we give an overview
that explains the general structure of the system independent of low-level
implementation details.  After describing the implementation of the
interpreter, we will be in a position to understand some of its limitations and
some of the subtle ways in which the query language’s logical operations differ
from the operations of mathematical logic.
</p>
<p>It should be apparent that the query evaluator must perform some kind of search
in order to match queries against facts and rules in the data base.  One way to
do this would be to implement the query system as a nondeterministic program,
using the <code>amb</code> evaluator of <a href="4_002e3.xhtml#g_t4_002e3">4.3</a> (see <a href="4_002e4_002e4_002e8.xhtml#Exercise-4_002e78">Exercise 4.78</a>).
Another possibility is to manage the search with the aid of streams.  Our
implementation follows this second approach.
</p>
<p>The query system is organized around two central operations called
<a id="index-pattern-matching"></a>
<em>pattern matching</em> and <a id="index-unification-1"></a>
<em>unification</em>.  We first describe
pattern matching and explain how this operation, together with the organization
of information in terms of streams of frames, enables us to implement both
simple and compound queries.  We next discuss unification, a generalization of
pattern matching needed to implement rules.  Finally, we show how the entire
query interpreter fits together through a procedure that classifies expressions
in a manner analogous to the way <code>eval</code> classifies expressions for the
interpreter described in <a href="4_002e1.xhtml#g_t4_002e1">4.1</a>.
</p>
<a id="Pattern-matching"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Pattern matching</h5>

<p>A <a id="index-pattern-matcher"></a>
<em>pattern matcher</em> is a program that tests whether some datum fits a
specified pattern.  For example, the data list <code>((a b) c (a b))</code> matches
the pattern <code>(?x c ?x)</code> with the pattern variable <code>?x</code> bound to
<code>(a b)</code>.  The same data list matches the pattern <code>(?x ?y ?z)</code> with
<code>?x</code> and <code>?z</code> both bound to <code>(a b)</code> and <code>?y</code> bound to
<code>c</code>.  It also matches the pattern <code>((?x ?y) c (?x ?y))</code> with
<code>?x</code> bound to <code>a</code> and <code>?y</code> bound to <code>b</code>.  However, it does
not match the pattern <code>(?x a ?y)</code>, since that pattern specifies a list
whose second element is the symbol <code>a</code>.
</p>
<p>The pattern matcher used by the query system takes as inputs a pattern, a
datum, and a <a id="index-frame"></a>
<em>frame</em> that specifies bindings for various pattern
variables.  It checks whether the datum matches the pattern in a way that is
consistent with the bindings already in the frame.  If so, it returns the given
frame augmented by any bindings that may have been determined by the match.
Otherwise, it indicates that the match has failed.
</p>
<p>For example, using the pattern <code>(?x ?y ?x)</code> to match <code>(a b a)</code> given
an empty frame will return a frame specifying that <code>?x</code> is bound to
<code>a</code> and <code>?y</code> is bound to <code>b</code>.  Trying the match with the same
pattern, the same datum, and a frame specifying that <code>?y</code> is bound to
<code>a</code> will fail.  Trying the match with the same pattern, the same datum,
and a frame in which <code>?y</code> is bound to <code>b</code> and <code>?x</code> is unbound
will return the given frame augmented by a binding of <code>?x</code> to <code>a</code>.
</p>
<p>The pattern matcher is all the mechanism that is needed to process simple
queries that don’t involve rules.  For instance, to process the query
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">job </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">computer programmer</span><span class="clo">))</span></pre></div>

<p>we scan through all assertions in the data base and select those that match the
pattern with respect to an initially empty frame.  For each match we find, we
use the frame returned by the match to instantiate the pattern with a value for
<code>?x</code>.
</p>
<a id="Streams-of-frames"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Streams of frames</h5>

<p>The testing of patterns against frames is organized through the use of streams.
Given a single frame, the matching process runs through the data-base entries
one by one.  For each data-base entry, the matcher generates either a special
symbol indicating that the match has failed or an extension to the frame.  The
results for all the data-base entries are collected into a stream, which is
passed through a filter to weed out the failures.  The result is a stream of
all the frames that extend the given frame via a match to some assertion in the
data base.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF271" href="#FOOT271"><sup>271</sup></a>
</p>
<p>In our system, a query takes an input stream of frames and performs the above
matching operation for every frame in the stream, as indicated in <a href="#Figure-4_002e4">Figure 4.4</a>.  
That is, for each frame in the input stream, the query generates a new
stream consisting of all extensions to that frame by matches to assertions in
the data base.  All these streams are then combined to form one huge stream,
which contains all possible extensions of every frame in the input stream.
This stream is the output of the query.
</p>
<figure class="float">
<a id="Figure-4_002e4"></a>

<figcaption class="float-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 4.4:</strong> A query processes a stream of frames.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To answer a simple query, we use the query with an input stream consisting of a
single empty frame.  The resulting output stream contains all extensions to the
empty frame (that is, all answers to our query).  This stream of frames is then
used to generate a stream of copies of the original query pattern with the
variables instantiated by the values in each frame, and this is the stream that
is finally printed.
</p>
<a id="Compound-queries-1"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Compound queries</h5>

<p>The real elegance of the stream-of-frames implementation is evident when we
deal with compound queries.  The processing of compound queries makes use of
the ability of our matcher to demand that a match be consistent with a
specified frame.  For example, to handle the <code>and</code> of two queries, such as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">and</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">can-do-job 
      </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x 
      </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">computer programmer trainee</span><span class="clo">))</span><span class="pln">
     </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">job </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">person </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x</span><span class="clo">))</span></pre></div>

<p>(informally, “Find all people who can do the job of a computer programmer
trainee”), we first find all entries that match the pattern
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">can-do-job </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">computer programmer trainee</span><span class="clo">))</span></pre></div>

<p>This produces a stream of frames, each of which contains a binding for
<code>?x</code>.  Then for each frame in the stream we find all entries that match
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">job </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">person </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x</span><span class="clo">)</span></pre></div>

<p>in a way that is consistent with the given binding for <code>?x</code>.  Each such
match will produce a frame containing bindings for <code>?x</code> and
<code>?person</code>.  The <code>and</code> of two queries can be viewed as a series
combination of the two component queries, as shown in <a href="#Figure-4_002e5">Figure 4.5</a>.  The
frames that pass through the first query filter are filtered and further
extended by the second query.
</p>
<figure class="float">
<a id="Figure-4_002e5"></a>

<figcaption class="float-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 4.5:</strong> The <code>and</code> combination of two queries is produced by operating on the stream of frames in series.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="#Figure-4_002e6">Figure 4.6</a> shows the analogous method for computing the <code>or</code> of two
queries as a parallel combination of the two component queries.  The input
stream of frames is extended separately by each query.  The two resulting
streams are then merged to produce the final output stream.
</p>
<figure class="float">
<a id="Figure-4_002e6"></a>

<figcaption class="float-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 4.6:</strong> The <code>or</code> combination of two queries is produced by operating on the stream of frames in parallel and merging the results.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Even from this high-level description, it is apparent that the processing of
compound queries can be slow.  For example, since a query may produce more than
one output frame for each input frame, and each query in an <code>and</code> gets its
input frames from the previous query, an <code>and</code> query could, in the worst
case, have to perform a number of matches that is exponential in the number of
queries (see <a href="4_002e4_002e4_002e8.xhtml#Exercise-4_002e76">Exercise 4.76</a>).<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF272" href="#FOOT272"><sup>272</sup></a> Though systems for
handling only simple queries are quite practical, dealing with complex queries
is extremely difficult.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF273" href="#FOOT273"><sup>273</sup></a>
</p>
<p>From the stream-of-frames viewpoint, the <code>not</code> of some query acts as a
filter that removes all frames for which the query can be satisfied.  For
instance, given the pattern
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">not </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">job </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">computer programmer</span><span class="clo">)))</span></pre></div>

<p>we attempt, for each frame in the input stream, to produce extension frames
that satisfy <code>(job ?x (computer programmer))</code>.  We remove from the input
stream all frames for which such extensions exist.  The result is a stream
consisting of only those frames in which the binding for <code>?x</code> does not
satisfy <code>(job ?x (computer programmer))</code>.  For example, in processing the
query
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">and</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">supervisor </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">y</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">
     </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">not </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">job </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">computer programmer</span><span class="clo">))))</span></pre></div>

<p>the first clause will generate frames with bindings for <code>?x</code> and
<code>?y</code>.  The <code>not</code> clause will then filter these by removing all frames
in which the binding for <code>?x</code> satisfies the restriction that <code>?x</code> is
a computer programmer.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF274" href="#FOOT274"><sup>274</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The <code>lisp-value</code> special form is implemented as a similar filter on frame
streams.  We use each frame in the stream to instantiate any variables in the
pattern, then apply the Lisp predicate.  We remove from the input stream all
frames for which the predicate fails.
</p>
<a id="Unification"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Unification</h5>

<p>In order to handle rules in the query language, we must be able to find the
rules whose conclusions match a given query pattern.  Rule conclusions are like
assertions except that they can contain variables, so we will need a
generalization of pattern matching—called <a id="index-unification-2"></a>
<em>unification</em>—in which
both the “pattern” and the “datum” may contain variables.
</p>
<p>A unifier takes two patterns, each containing constants and variables, and
determines whether it is possible to assign values to the variables that will
make the two patterns equal.  If so, it returns a frame containing these
bindings.  For example, unifying <code>(?x a ?y)</code> and <code>(?y ?z a)</code> will
specify a frame in which <code>?x</code>, <code>?y</code>, and <code>?z</code> must all be bound
to <code>a</code>.  On the other hand, unifying <code>(?x ?y a)</code> and <code>(?x b ?y)</code>
will fail, because there is no value for <code>?y</code> that can make the two
patterns equal.  (For the second elements of the patterns to be equal,
<code>?y</code> would have to be <code>b</code>; however, for the third elements to be
equal, <code>?y</code> would have to be <code>a</code>.)  The unifier used in the query
system, like the pattern matcher, takes a frame as input and performs
unifications that are consistent with this frame.
</p>
<p>The unification algorithm is the most technically difficult part of the query
system.  With complex patterns, performing unification may seem to require
deduction.  To unify <code>(?x ?x)</code> and <code>((a ?y c) (a b ?z))</code>, for
example, the algorithm must infer that <code>?x</code> should be <code>(a b c)</code>,
<code>?y</code> should be <code>b</code>, and <code>?z</code> should be <code>c</code>.  We may think
of this process as solving a set of equations among the pattern components.  In
general, these are simultaneous equations, which may require substantial
manipulation to solve.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF275" href="#FOOT275"><sup>275</sup></a> For example, unifying <code>(?x ?x)</code> and
<code>((a ?y c) (a b ?z))</code> may be thought of as specifying the simultaneous
equations
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">a </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">y c</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">a b </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">z</span><span class="clo">)</span></pre></div>

<p>These equations imply that
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">a </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">y c</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">a b </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">z</span><span class="clo">)</span></pre></div>

<p>which in turn implies that
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> a</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">y </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> b</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> c </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">z</span><span class="pun">,</span></pre></div>

<p>and hence that
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">a b c</span><span class="clo">)</span></pre></div>

<p>In a successful pattern match, all pattern variables become bound, and the
values to which they are bound contain only constants.  This is also true of
all the examples of unification we have seen so far.  In general, however, a
successful unification may not completely determine the variable values; some
variables may remain unbound and others may be bound to values that contain
variables.
</p>
<p>Consider the unification of <code>(?x a)</code> and <code>((b ?y) ?z)</code>.  We can
deduce that <code>?x = (b ?y)</code> and <code>a = ?z</code>, but we cannot further solve
for <code>?x</code> or <code>?y</code>.  The unification doesn’t fail, since it is
certainly possible to make the two patterns equal by assigning values to
<code>?x</code> and <code>?y</code>.  Since this match in no way restricts the values
<code>?y</code> can take on, no binding for <code>?y</code> is put into the result frame.
The match does, however, restrict the value of <code>?x</code>.  Whatever value
<code>?y</code> has, <code>?x</code> must be <code>(b ?y)</code>.  A binding of <code>?x</code> to the
pattern <code>(b ?y)</code> is thus put into the frame.  If a value for <code>?y</code> is
later determined and added to the frame (by a pattern match or unification that
is required to be consistent with this frame), the previously bound <code>?x</code>
will refer to this value.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF276" href="#FOOT276"><sup>276</sup></a>
</p>
<a id="Applying-rules"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Applying rules</h5>

<p>Unification is the key to the component of the query system that makes
inferences from rules. To see how this is accomplished, consider processing a
query that involves applying a rule, such as
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">lives-near </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">x </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">Hacker Alyssa P</span><span class="clo">))</span></pre></div>

<p>To process this query, we first use the ordinary pattern-match procedure
described above to see if there are any assertions in the data base that match
this pattern.  (There will not be any in this case, since our data base
includes no direct assertions about who lives near whom.)  The next step is to
attempt to unify the query pattern with the conclusion of each rule.  We find
that the pattern unifies with the conclusion of the rule
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">rule </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">lives-near </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">person-1 </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">person-2</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">
      </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">and</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">address </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">person-1 
                    </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">town </span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">rest-1</span><span class="clo">))</span><span class="pln">
           </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">address </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">person-2 
                    </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">town </span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">rest-2</span><span class="clo">))</span><span class="pln">
           </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">not </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">same </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">person-1 </span><span class="pun">?</span><span class="pln">person-2</span><span class="clo">))))</span></pre></div>

<p>resulting in a frame specifying that <code>?person-2</code> is bound to <code>(Hacker
Alyssa P)</code> and that <code>?x</code> should be bound to (have the same value as)
<code>?person-1</code>.  Now, relative to this frame, we evaluate the compound query
given by the body of the rule.  Successful matches will extend this frame by
providing a binding for <code>?person-1</code>, and consequently a value for
<code>?x</code>, which we can use to instantiate the original query pattern.
</p>
<p>In general, the query evaluator uses the following method to apply a rule when
trying to establish a query pattern in a frame that specifies bindings for some
of the pattern variables:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Unify the query with the conclusion of the rule to form, if successful, an
extension of the original frame.

</li><li> Relative to the extended frame, evaluate the query formed by the body of the
rule.

</li></ul>

<p>Notice how similar this is to the method for applying a procedure in the
<code>eval</code>/<code>apply</code> evaluator for Lisp:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Bind the procedure’s parameters to its arguments to form a frame that extends
the original procedure environment.

</li><li> Relative to the extended environment, evaluate the expression formed by the
body of the procedure.

</li></ul>

<p>The similarity between the two evaluators should come as no surprise.  Just as
procedure definitions are the means of abstraction in Lisp, rule definitions
are the means of abstraction in the query language.  In each case, we unwind
the abstraction by creating appropriate bindings and evaluating the rule or
procedure body relative to these.
</p>
<a id="Simple-queries-1"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Simple queries</h5>

<p>We saw earlier in this section how to evaluate simple queries in the absence of
rules.  Now that we have seen how to apply rules, we can describe how to
evaluate simple queries by using both rules and assertions.
</p>
<p>Given the query pattern and a stream of frames, we produce, for each frame in
the input stream, two streams:
</p>
<ul>
<li> a stream of extended frames obtained by matching the pattern against all
assertions in the data base (using the pattern matcher), and

</li><li> a stream of extended frames obtained by applying all possible rules (using the
unifier).<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF277" href="#FOOT277"><sup>277</sup></a>

</li></ul>

<p>Appending these two streams produces a stream that consists of all the ways
that the given pattern can be satisfied consistent with the original frame.
These streams (one for each frame in the input stream) are now all combined to
form one large stream, which therefore consists of all the ways that any of the
frames in the original input stream can be extended to produce a match with the
given pattern.
</p>
<a id="The-query-evaluator-and-the-driver-loop"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">The query evaluator and the driver loop</h5>

<p>Despite the complexity of the underlying matching operations, the system is
organized much like an evaluator for any language.  The procedure that
coordinates the matching operations is called <code>qeval</code>, and it plays a role
analogous to that of the <code>eval</code> procedure for Lisp.  <code>Qeval</code> takes as
inputs a query and a stream of frames.  Its output is a stream of frames,
corresponding to successful matches to the query pattern, that extend some
frame in the input stream, as indicated in <a href="#Figure-4_002e4">Figure 4.4</a>.  Like <code>eval</code>,
<code>qeval</code> classifies the different types of expressions (queries) and
dispatches to an appropriate procedure for each.  There is a procedure for each
special form (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, and <code>lisp-value</code>) and one
for simple queries.
</p>
<p>The driver loop, which is analogous to the <code>driver-loop</code> procedure for the
other evaluators in this chapter, reads queries from the terminal.  For each
query, it calls <code>qeval</code> with the query and a stream that consists of a
single empty frame.  This will produce the stream of all possible matches (all
possible extensions to the empty frame).  For each frame in the resulting
stream, it instantiates the original query using the values of the variables
found in the frame.  This stream of instantiated queries is then
printed.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF278" href="#FOOT278"><sup>278</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The driver also checks for the special command <code>assert!</code>, which signals
that the input is not a query but rather an assertion or rule to be added to
the data base.  For instance,
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">assert! </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">job </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">Bitdiddle Ben</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">

Because matching is generally very expensive, we would like
to avoid applying the full matcher to every element of the data base.  This is
usually arranged by breaking up the process into a fast, coarse match and the
final match.  The coarse match filters the data base to produce a small set of
candidates for the final match.  With care, we can arrange our data base so
that some of the work of coarse matching can be done when the data base is
constructed rather then when we want to select the candidates.  This is called
<a id="index-indexing"></a>
<em>indexing</em> the data base.  There is a vast technology built around
data-base-indexing schemes.  Our implementation, described in 
<a href="4_002e4_002e4.xhtml#g_t4_002e4_002e4">4.4.4</a>, contains a simple-minded form of such an optimization.</p>
</div>
<div id="FOOT272"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF272"><sup>272</sup></a>
But this kind of exponential
explosion is not common in <code>and</code> queries because the added conditions tend
to reduce rather than expand the number of frames produced.</p>
</div>
<div id="FOOT273"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF273"><sup>273</sup></a>
There is a large literature on
data-base-management systems that is concerned with how to handle complex
queries efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div id="FOOT274"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF274"><sup>274</sup></a>
There is a subtle difference between this
filter implementation of <code>not</code> and the usual meaning of <code>not</code> in
mathematical logic.  See <a href="4_002e4_002e3.xhtml#g_t4_002e4_002e3">4.4.3</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="FOOT275"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF275"><sup>275</sup></a>
In one-sided pattern matching, all the
equations that contain pattern variables are explicit and already solved for
the unknown (the pattern variable).</p>
</div>
<div id="FOOT276"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF276"><sup>276</sup></a>
Another way to think of unification is that
it generates the most general pattern that is a specialization of the two input
patterns.  That is, the unification of <code>(?x a)</code> and <code>((b ?y) ?z)</code> is
<code>((b ?y) a)</code>, and the unification of <code>(?x a ?y)</code> and <code>(?y ?z
a)</code>, discussed above, is <code>(a a a)</code>.  For our implementation, it is more
convenient to think of the result of unification as a frame rather than a
pattern.</p>
</div>
<div id="FOOT277"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF277"><sup>277</sup></a>
Since unification is a generalization of matching, we could
simplify the system by using the unifier to produce both streams.  Treating the
easy case with the simple matcher, however, illustrates how matching (as
opposed to full-blown unification) can be useful in its own right.</p>
</div>
<div id="FOOT278"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF278"><sup>278</sup></a>
The reason we use streams (rather than lists) of frames is
that the recursive application of rules can generate infinite numbers of values
that satisfy a query.  The delayed evaluation embodied in streams is crucial
here: The system will print responses one by one as they are generated,
regardless of whether there are a finite or infinite number of responses.</p>
