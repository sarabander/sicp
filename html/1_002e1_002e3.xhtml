<a id="Evaluating-Combinations"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">1.1.3</span><span class="sectitle">Evaluating Combinations</span></h4>

<p>One of our goals in this chapter is to isolate issues about thinking
procedurally.  As a case in point, let us consider that, in evaluating
combinations, the interpreter is itself following a procedure.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To evaluate a combination, do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.

</li><li> Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the
operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpressions (the
operands).

</li></ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about processes in
general.  First, observe that the first step dictates that in order to
accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must first perform the
evaluation process on each element of the combination.  Thus, the evaluation
rule is <a id="index-recursive"></a>
<em>recursive</em> in nature; that is, it includes, as one of its
steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF10" href="#FOOT10"><sup>10</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Notice how succinctly the idea of recursion can be used to express what, in the
case of a deeply nested combination, would otherwise be viewed as a rather
complicated process.  For example, evaluating
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pun">*</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">2</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pun">*</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">4</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">6</span><span class="clo">))</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">3</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">5</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">7</span><span class="clo">))</span></pre></div>

<p>requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different combinations.
We can obtain a picture of this process by representing the combination in the
form of a tree, as shown in <a href="#Figure-1_002e1">Figure 1.1</a>.  Each combination is represented
by a node with branches corresponding to the operator and the operands of the
combination stemming from it.  The terminal nodes (that is, nodes with no
branches stemming from them) represent either operators or numbers.  Viewing
evaluation in terms of the tree, we can imagine that the values of the operands
percolate upward, starting from the terminal nodes and then combining at higher
and higher levels.  In general, we shall see that recursion is a very powerful
technique for dealing with hierarchical, treelike objects.  In fact, the
“percolate values upward” form of the evaluation rule is an example of a
general kind of process known as <a id="index-tree-accumulation"></a>
<em>tree accumulation</em>.

</figure>

<p>Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings us to the
point where we need to evaluate, not combinations, but primitive expressions
such as numerals, built-in operators, or other names.  We take care of the
primitive cases by stipulating that
</p>
<ul>
<li> the values of numerals are the numbers that they name,

</li><li> the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences that
carry out the corresponding operations, and

</li><li> the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the
environment.

</li></ul>

<p>We may regard the second rule as a special case of the third one by stipulating
that symbols such as <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are also included in the global
environment, and are associated with the sequences of machine instructions that
are their “values.”  The key point to notice is the role of the environment
in determining the meaning of the symbols in expressions.  In an interactive
language such as Lisp, it is meaningless to speak of the value of an expression
such as <code>(+ x 1)</code> without specifying any information about the environment
that would provide a meaning for the symbol <code>x</code> (or even for the symbol
<code>+</code>).  As we shall see in <a href="Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3">Chapter 3</a>, the general notion of the
environment as providing a context in which evaluation takes place will play an
important role in our understanding of program execution.
</p>
<p>Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not handle definitions.  For
instance, evaluating <code>(define x 3)</code> does not apply <code>define</code> to two
arguments, one of which is the value of the symbol <code>x</code> and the other of
which is 3, since the purpose of the <code>define</code> is precisely to associate
<code>x</code> with a value.  (That is, <code>(define x 3)</code> is not a combination.)
</p>
<p>Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called <a id="index-special-forms"></a>
<em>special forms</em>.  
<code>Define</code> is the only example of a special form that we have seen
so far, but we will meet others shortly.  Each special form has its own
evaluation rule. The various kinds of expressions (each with its associated
evaluation rule) constitute the syntax of the programming language.  In
comparison with most other programming languages, Lisp has a very simple
syntax; that is, the evaluation rule for expressions can be described by a
simple general rule together with specialized rules for a small number of
special forms.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF11" href="#FOOT11"><sup>11</sup></a>

<div id="FOOT10"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF10"><sup>10</sup></a>
It may seem strange that
the evaluation rule says, as part of the first step, that we should evaluate
the leftmost element of a combination, since at this point that can only be an
operator such as <code>+</code> or <code>*</code> representing a built-in primitive
procedure such as addition or multiplication.  We will see later that it is
useful to be able to work with combinations whose operators are themselves
compound expressions.</p>

<div id="FOOT11"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF11"><sup>11</sup></a>
Special syntactic forms that are simply convenient
alternative surface structures for things that can be written in more uniform
ways are sometimes called <a id="index-syntactic-sugar"></a>
<em>syntactic sugar</em>, to use a phrase coined by
Peter Landin.  In comparison with users of other languages, Lisp programmers,
as a rule, are less concerned with matters of syntax.  (By contrast, examine
any Pascal manual and notice how much of it is devoted to descriptions of
syntax.)  This disdain for syntax is due partly to the flexibility of Lisp,
which makes it easy to change surface syntax, and partly to the observation
that many “convenient” syntactic constructs, which make the language less
uniform, end up causing more trouble than they are worth when programs become
large and complex.  In the words of Alan Perlis, “Syntactic sugar causes
cancer of the semicolon.”</p>
