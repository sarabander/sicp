<a id="Combining-Data-of-Different-Types"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">2.5.2</span><span class="sectitle">Combining Data of Different Types</span></h4>

<p>We have seen how to define a unified arithmetic system that encompasses
ordinary numbers, complex numbers, rational numbers, and any other type of
number we might decide to invent, but we have ignored an important issue.  The
operations we have defined so far treat the different data types as being
completely independent.  Thus, there are separate packages for adding, say, two
ordinary numbers, or two complex numbers.  What we have not yet considered is
the fact that it is meaningful to define operations that cross the type
boundaries, such as the addition of a complex number to an ordinary number.  We
have gone to great pains to introduce barriers between parts of our programs so
that they can be developed and understood separately.  We would like to
introduce the cross-type operations in some carefully controlled way, so that
we can support them without seriously violating our module boundaries.
</p>
<p>One way to handle cross-type operations is to design a different procedure for
each possible combination of types for which the operation is valid.  For
example, we could extend the complex-number package so that it provides a
procedure for adding complex numbers to ordinary numbers and installs this in
the table using the tag <code>(complex scheme-number)</code>:<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF115" href="#FOOT115"><sup>115</sup></a>
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">define</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">add-complex-to-schemenum z x</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">

                       </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">imag-part z</span><span class="clo">)))</span><span class="pln">

</span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">put </span><span class="lit">'add</span><span class="pln">

<p>This technique works, but it is cumbersome.  With such a system, the cost of
introducing a new type is not just the construction of the package of
procedures for that type but also the construction and installation of the
procedures that implement the cross-type operations.  This can easily be much
more code than is needed to define the operations on the type itself.  The
method also undermines our ability to combine separate packages additively, or
at least to limit the extent to which the implementors of the individual packages
need to take account of other packages.  For instance, in the example above, it
seems reasonable that handling mixed operations on complex numbers and ordinary
numbers should be the responsibility of the complex-number package.  Combining
rational numbers and complex numbers, however, might be done by the complex
package, by the rational package, or by some third package that uses operations
extracted from these two packages.  Formulating coherent policies on the
division of responsibility among packages can be an overwhelming task in
designing systems with many packages and many cross-type operations.
</p>
<a id="Coercion"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Coercion</h5>

<p>In the general situation of completely unrelated operations acting on
completely unrelated types, implementing explicit cross-type operations,
cumbersome though it may be, is the best that one can hope for.  Fortunately,
we can usually do better by taking advantage of additional structure that may
be latent in our type system.  Often the different data types are not
completely independent, and there may be ways by which objects of one type may
be viewed as being of another type.  This process is called <a id="index-coercion"></a>
<em>coercion</em>.
For example, if we are asked to arithmetically combine an ordinary number with
a complex number, we can view the ordinary number as a complex number whose
imaginary part is zero.  This transforms the problem to that of combining two
complex numbers, which can be handled in the ordinary way by the
complex-arithmetic package.
</p>
<p>In general, we can implement this idea by designing coercion procedures that
transform an object of one type into an equivalent object of another type.
Here is a typical coercion procedure, which transforms a given ordinary number
to a complex number with that real part and zero imaginary part:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">define</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">scheme-number-</span><span class="pun">&gt;</span><span class="pln">complex n</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">
  </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">make-complex-from-real-imag 
   </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">contents n</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="clo">))</span></pre></div>

<p>We install these coercion procedures in a special coercion table, indexed under
the names of the two types:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">put-coercion </span><span class="lit">'scheme-number</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">'complex</span><span class="pln"> 
              scheme-number-</span><span class="pun">&gt;</span><span class="pln">complex</span><span class="clo">)</span></pre></div>

<p>(We assume that there are <code>put-coercion</code> and <code>get-coercion</code>
procedures available for manipulating this table.)  Generally some of the slots
in the table will be empty, because it is not generally possible to coerce an
arbitrary data object of each type into all other types.  For example, there is
no way to coerce an arbitrary complex number to an ordinary number, so there
will be no general <code>complex-&gt;scheme-number</code> procedure included in the
table.
</p>
<p>Once the coercion table has been set up, we can handle coercion in a uniform
manner by modifying the <code>apply-generic</code> procedure of <a href="2_002e4_002e3.xhtml#g_t2_002e4_002e3">2.4.3</a>.
When asked to apply an operation, we first check whether the operation is
defined for the arguments’ types, just as before.  If so, we dispatch to the
procedure found in the operation-and-type table.  Otherwise, we try coercion.
For simplicity, we consider only the case where there are two
arguments.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF116" href="#FOOT116"><sup>116</sup></a>  We check the
coercion table to see if objects of the first type can be coerced to the second
type.  If so, we coerce the first argument and try the operation again.  If
objects of the first type cannot in general be coerced to the second type, we
try the coercion the other way around to see if there is a way to coerce the
second argument to the type of the first argument.  Finally, if there is no
known way to coerce either type to the other type, we give up.  Here is the
procedure:

<p>This coercion scheme has many advantages over the method of defining explicit
cross-type operations, as outlined above.  Although we still need to write
coercion procedures to relate the types (possibly <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <msup>
    <mi>n</mi>
    <mn>2</mn>
  </msup>
</math> procedures for a
system with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>n</mi>
</math> types), we need to write only one procedure for each pair of
types rather than a different procedure for each collection of types and each
generic operation.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF117" href="#FOOT117"><sup>117</sup></a>  What we are counting on here is the fact
that the appropriate transformation between types depends only on the types
themselves, not on the operation to be applied.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there may be applications for which our coercion scheme is
not general enough.  Even when neither of the objects to be combined can be
converted to the type of the other it may still be possible to perform the
operation by converting both objects to a third type.  In order to deal with
such complexity and still preserve modularity in our programs, it is usually
necessary to build systems that take advantage of still further structure in
the relations among types, as we discuss next.
</p>
<a id="Hierarchies-of-types"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Hierarchies of types</h5>

<p>The coercion scheme presented above relied on the existence of natural
relations between pairs of types.  Often there is more “global” structure in
how the different types relate to each other.  For instance, suppose we are
building a generic arithmetic system to handle integers, rational numbers, real
numbers, and complex numbers.  In such a system, it is quite natural to regard
an integer as a special kind of rational number, which is in turn a special
kind of real number, which is in turn a special kind of complex number.  What
we actually have is a so-called <a id="index-hierarchy-of-types"></a>
<em>hierarchy of types</em>, in which, for
example, integers are a <a id="index-subtype"></a>
<em>subtype</em> of rational numbers (i.e., any
operation that can be applied to a rational number can automatically be applied
to an integer).  Conversely, we say that rational numbers form a
<a id="index-supertype"></a>
<em>supertype</em> of integers.  The particular hierarchy we have here is of a
very simple kind, in which each type has at most one supertype and at most one
subtype.  Such a structure, called a <a id="index-tower"></a>
<em>tower</em>, is illustrated in
<a href="#Figure-2_002e25">Figure 2.25</a>.
</p>
<figure class="float">
<a id="Figure-2_002e25"></a>
<object style="width: 8.46ex; height: 22.71ex;" data="fig/chap2/Fig2.25.std.svg" type="image/svg+xml">SVG</object>

<figcaption class="float-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 2.25:</strong> A tower of types.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If we have a tower structure, then we can greatly simplify the problem of
adding a new type to the hierarchy, for we need only specify how the new type
is embedded in the next supertype above it and how it is the supertype of the
type below it.  For example, if we want to add an integer to a complex number,
we need not explicitly define a special coercion procedure
<code>integer-&gt;complex</code>.  Instead, we define how an integer can be transformed
into a rational number, how a rational number is transformed into a real
number, and how a real number is transformed into a complex number.  We then
allow the system to transform the integer into a complex number through these
steps and then add the two complex numbers.
</p>
<p>We can redesign our <code>apply-generic</code> procedure in the following way: For
each type, we need to supply a <code>raise</code> procedure, which “raises” objects
of that type one level in the tower.  Then when the system is required to
operate on objects of different types it can successively raise the lower types
until all the objects are at the same level in the tower.  (<a href="#Exercise-2_002e83">Exercise 2.83</a>
and <a href="#Exercise-2_002e84">Exercise 2.84</a> concern the details of implementing such a strategy.)
</p>
<p>Another advantage of a tower is that we can easily implement the notion that
every type “inherits” all operations defined on a supertype.  For instance,
if we do not supply a special procedure for finding the real part of an
integer, we should nevertheless expect that <code>real-part</code> will be defined
for integers by virtue of the fact that integers are a subtype of complex
numbers.  In a tower, we can arrange for this to happen in a uniform way by
modifying <code>apply-generic</code>.  If the required operation is not directly
defined for the type of the object given, we raise the object to its supertype
and try again.  We thus crawl up the tower, transforming our argument as we go,
until we either find a level at which the desired operation can be performed or
hit the top (in which case we give up).
</p>
<p>Yet another advantage of a tower over a more general hierarchy is that it gives
us a simple way to “lower” a data object to the simplest representation.  For
example, if we add <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
    <mn>2</mn>
    <mo>+</mo>
    <mn>3</mn>
    <mi>i</mi>
  </mrow>
</math> to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
    <mn>4</mn>
    <mo>−<!-- − --></mo>
    <mn>3</mn>
    <mi>i</mi>
  </mrow>
</math>, it would be nice to obtain the
answer as the integer 6 rather than as the complex number <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
    <mn>6</mn>
    <mo>+</mo>
    <mn>0</mn>
    <mi>i</mi>
  </mrow>
</math>.
<a href="#Exercise-2_002e85">Exercise 2.85</a> discusses a way to implement such a lowering operation.
(The trick is that we need a general way to distinguish those objects that can
be lowered, such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
    <mn>6</mn>
    <mo>+</mo>
    <mn>0</mn>
    <mi>i</mi>
  </mrow>
</math>, from those that cannot, such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
    <mn>6</mn>
    <mo>+</mo>
    <mn>2</mn>
    <mi>i</mi>
  </mrow>
</math>.)
</p>
<a id="Inadequacies-of-hierarchies"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Inadequacies of hierarchies</h5>

<p>If the data types in our system can be naturally arranged in a tower, this
greatly simplifies the problems of dealing with generic operations on different
types, as we have seen.  Unfortunately, this is usually not the case.
<a href="#Figure-2_002e26">Figure 2.26</a> illustrates a more complex arrangement of mixed types, this
one showing relations among different types of geometric figures.  We see that,
in general, a type may have more than one subtype.  Triangles and
quadrilaterals, for instance, are both subtypes of polygons.  In addition, a
type may have more than one supertype.  For example, an isosceles right
triangle may be regarded either as an isosceles triangle or as a right
triangle.  This multiple-supertypes issue is particularly thorny, since it
means that there is no unique way to “raise” a type in the hierarchy.
Finding the “correct” supertype in which to apply an operation to an object
may involve considerable searching through the entire type network on the part
of a procedure such as <code>apply-generic</code>.  Since there generally are
multiple subtypes for a type, there is a similar problem in coercing a value
“down” the type hierarchy.  Dealing with large numbers of interrelated types
while still preserving modularity in the design of large systems is very
difficult, and is an area of much current research.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF118" href="#FOOT118"><sup>118</sup></a>

<li> With Louis’s coercion procedures installed, what happens if
<code>apply-generic</code> is called with two arguments of type <code>scheme-number</code>
or two arguments of type <code>complex</code> for an operation that is not found in
the table for those types?  For example, assume that we’ve defined a generic
exponentiation operation:

<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">define</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">exp x y</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln"> 
  </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">apply-generic </span><span class="lit">'exp</span><span class="pln"> x y</span><span class="clo">))</span></pre></div>

<p>and have put a procedure for exponentiation in the Scheme-number
package but not in any other package:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="roman"><span class="com">;; following added to Scheme-number package</span></span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">put </span><span class="lit">'exp</span><span class="pln"> 
     </span><span class="lit">'</span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">scheme-number scheme-number</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">
     </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">lambda</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">x y</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln"> 
       </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">tag </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">expt x y</span><span class="clo">))))</span><span class="pln"> 
       </span><span class="roman"><span class="com">; using primitive </span><code><span class="com">expt</span></code></span>
</pre></div>

<p>What happens if we call <code>exp</code> with two complex numbers as arguments?
</p>
</li><li> Is Louis correct that something had to be done about coercion with arguments of
the same type, or does <code>apply-generic</code> work correctly as is?

</li><li> Modify <code>apply-generic</code> so that it doesn’t try coercion if the two
arguments have the same type.

<p><strong><a id="Exercise-2_002e82"></a>Exercise 2.82:</strong> Show how to generalize
<code>apply-generic</code> to handle coercion in the general case of multiple
arguments.  One strategy is to attempt to coerce all the arguments to the type
of the first argument, then to the type of the second argument, and so on.
Give an example of a situation where this strategy (and likewise the
two-argument version given above) is not sufficiently general.  (Hint: Consider
the case where there are some suitable mixed-type operations present in the
table that will not be tried.)

generic arithmetic system for dealing with the tower of types shown in
<a href="#Figure-2_002e25">Figure 2.25</a>: integer, rational, real, complex.  For each type (except
complex), design a procedure that raises objects of that type one level in the
tower.  Show how to install a generic <code>raise</code> operation that will work for
each type (except complex).

which of two types is higher in the tower.  Do this in a manner that is
“compatible” with the rest of the system and will not lead to problems in
adding new levels to the tower.

<blockquote>
<p><strong><a id="Exercise-2_002e85"></a>Exercise 2.85:</strong> This section mentioned a method
for “simplifying” a data object by lowering it in the tower of types as far
as possible.  Design a procedure <code>drop</code> that accomplishes this for the
tower described in <a href="#Exercise-2_002e83">Exercise 2.83</a>.  The key is to decide, in some general
way, whether an object can be lowered.  For example, the complex number 
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
    <mn>1.5</mn>
    <mo>+</mo>
    <mn>0</mn>
    <mi>i</mi>
  </mrow>
</math> can be lowered as far as <code>real</code>, the complex number <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
    <mn>1</mn>
    <mo>+</mo>
    <mn>0</mn>
    <mi>i</mi>
  </mrow>
</math> can
be lowered as far as <code>integer</code>, and the complex number <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
    <mn>2</mn>
    <mo>+</mo>
    <mn>3</mn>
    <mi>i</mi>
  </mrow>
</math> cannot
be lowered at all.  Here is a plan for determining whether an object can be
lowered: Begin by defining a generic operation <code>project</code> that “pushes”
an object down in the tower.  For example, projecting a complex number would
involve throwing away the imaginary part.  Then a number can be dropped if,
when we <code>project</code> it and <code>raise</code> the result back to the type we
started with, we end up with something equal to what we started with.  Show how
to implement this idea in detail, by writing a <code>drop</code> procedure that drops
an object as far as possible.  You will need to design the various projection
operations<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF119" href="#FOOT119"><sup>119</sup></a> and
install <code>project</code> as a generic operation in the system.  You will also
need to make use of a generic equality predicate, such as described in
<a href="2_002e5_002e1.xhtml#Exercise-2_002e79">Exercise 2.79</a>.  Finally, use <code>drop</code> to rewrite <code>apply-generic</code>
from <a href="#Exercise-2_002e84">Exercise 2.84</a> so that it “simplifies” its answers.

<p><strong><a id="Exercise-2_002e86"></a>Exercise 2.86:</strong> Suppose we want to handle complex
numbers whose real parts, imaginary parts, magnitudes, and angles can be either
ordinary numbers, rational numbers, or other numbers we might wish to add to
the system.  Describe and implement the changes to the system needed to
accommodate this.  You will have to define operations such as <code>sine</code> and
<code>cosine</code> that are generic over ordinary numbers and rational numbers.

type 1 to type 2 and from type 2 to type 3, then we can use this knowledge to
convert from type 1 to type 3.  This can greatly decrease the number of
coercion procedures we need to supply explicitly when we add a new type to the
system.  If we are willing to build the required amount of sophistication into
our system, we can have it search the “graph” of relations among types and
automatically generate those coercion procedures that can be inferred from the
ones that are supplied explicitly.</p>

This statement,
which also appears in the first edition of this book, is just as true now as it
was when we wrote it twelve years ago.  Developing a useful, general framework
for expressing the relations among different types of entities (what
philosophers call “ontology”) seems intractably difficult.  The main
difference between the confusion that existed ten years ago and the confusion
that exists now is that now a variety of inadequate ontological theories have
been embodied in a plethora of correspondingly inadequate programming
languages.  For example, much of the complexity of object-oriented programming
languages—and the subtle and confusing differences among contemporary
object-oriented languages—centers on the treatment of generic operations on
interrelated types.  Our own discussion of computational objects in
<a href="Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3">Chapter 3</a> avoids these issues entirely.  Readers familiar with
object-oriented programming will notice that we have much to say in
chapter 3 about local state, but we do not even mention “classes” or
“inheritance.”  In fact, we suspect that these problems cannot be adequately
addressed in terms of computer-language design alone, without also drawing on
work in knowledge representation and automated reasoning.</p>
