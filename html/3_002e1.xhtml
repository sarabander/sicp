<a id="Assignment-and-Local-State"></a>
<h3 class="section"><span class="secnum">3.1</span><span class="sectitle">Assignment and Local State</span></h3>

<p>We ordinarily view the world as populated by independent objects, each of which
has a state that changes over time.  An object is said to “have state” if its
behavior is influenced by its history.  A bank account, for example, has state
in that the answer to the question “Can I withdraw $100?”  depends upon the
history of deposit and withdrawal transactions.  We can characterize an
object’s state by one or more <a id="index-state-variables-1"></a>
<em>state variables</em>, which among them
maintain enough information about history to determine the object’s current
behavior.  In a simple banking system, we could characterize the state of an
account by a current balance rather than by remembering the entire history of
account transactions.
</p>
<p>In a system composed of many objects, the objects are rarely completely
independent.  Each may influence the states of others through interactions,
which serve to couple the state variables of one object to those of other
objects.  Indeed, the view that a system is composed of separate objects is
most useful when the state variables of the system can be grouped into closely
coupled subsystems that are only loosely coupled to other subsystems.
</p>
<p>This view of a system can be a powerful framework for organizing computational
models of the system.  For such a model to be modular, it should be decomposed
into computational objects that model the actual objects in the system.  Each
computational object must have its own <a id="index-local-state-variables"></a>
<em>local state variables</em>
describing the actual object’s state.  Since the states of objects in the
system being modeled change over time, the state variables of the corresponding
computational objects must also change.  If we choose to model the flow of time
in the system by the elapsed time in the computer, then we must have a way to
construct computational objects whose behaviors change as our programs run.  In
particular, if we wish to model state variables by ordinary symbolic names in
the programming language, then the language must provide an <a id="index-assignment-operator"></a>
<em>assignment operator</em> 
to enable us to change the value associated with a name.
