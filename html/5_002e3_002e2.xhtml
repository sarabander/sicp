<a id="Maintaining-the-Illusion-of-Infinite-Memory"></a>
<h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">5.3.2</span><span class="sectitle">Maintaining the Illusion of Infinite Memory</span></h4>

<p>The representation method outlined in <a href="5_002e3_002e1.xhtml#g_t5_002e3_002e1">5.3.1</a> solves the problem of
implementing list structure, provided that we have an infinite amount of
memory.  With a real computer we will eventually run out of free space in which
to construct new pairs.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF298" href="#FOOT298"><sup>298</sup></a>  However,
most of the pairs generated in a typical computation are used only to hold
intermediate results.  After these results are accessed, the pairs are no
longer needed—they are <a id="index-garbage"></a>
<em>garbage</em>.  For instance, the computation
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">accumulate 
 </span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln"> 
 </span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pln">
 </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">filter odd? </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">enumerate-interval </span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pln"> n</span><span class="clo">)))</span></pre></div>

<p>constructs two lists: the enumeration and the result of filtering the
enumeration.  When the accumulation is complete, these lists are no longer
needed, and the allocated memory can be reclaimed.  If we can arrange to
collect all the garbage periodically, and if this turns out to recycle memory
at about the same rate at which we construct new pairs, we will have preserved
the illusion that there is an infinite amount of memory.
</p>
<p>In order to recycle pairs, we must have a way to determine which allocated
pairs are not needed (in the sense that their contents can no longer influence
the future of the computation).  The method we shall examine for accomplishing
this is known as <a id="index-garbage-collection-1"></a>
<em>garbage collection</em>.  Garbage collection is based on
the observation that, at any moment in a Lisp interpretation, the only objects
that can affect the future of the computation are those that can be reached by
some succession of <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> operations starting from the
pointers that are currently in the machine registers.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF299" href="#FOOT299"><sup>299</sup></a>
Any memory cell that is not so accessible may be recycled.
</p>
<p>There are many ways to perform garbage collection.  The method we shall examine
here is called <a id="index-stop_002dand_002dcopy"></a>
<em>stop-and-copy</em>.  The basic idea is to divide memory
into two halves: “working memory” and “free memory.”  When <code>cons</code>
constructs pairs, it allocates these in working memory.  When working memory is
full, we perform garbage collection by locating all the useful pairs in working
memory and copying these into consecutive locations in free memory.  (The
useful pairs are located by tracing all the <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> pointers,
starting with the machine registers.)  Since we do not copy the garbage, there
will presumably be additional free memory that we can use to allocate new
pairs.  In addition, nothing in the working memory is needed, since all the
useful pairs in it have been copied.  Thus, if we interchange the roles of
working memory and free memory, we can continue processing; new pairs will be
allocated in the new working memory (which was the old free memory).  When this
is full, we can copy the useful pairs into the new free memory (which was the
old working memory).<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF300" href="#FOOT300"><sup>300</sup></a>
</p>
<a id="Implementation-of-a-stop_002dand_002dcopy-garbage-collector"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Implementation of a stop-and-copy garbage collector</h5>

<p>We now use our register-machine language to describe the stop-and-copy
algorithm in more detail.  We will assume that there is a register called
<code>root</code> that contains a pointer to a structure that eventually points at
all accessible data.  This can be arranged by storing the contents of all the
machine registers in a pre-allocated list pointed at by <code>root</code> just before
starting garbage collection.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF301" href="#FOOT301"><sup>301</sup></a> We also assume that, in addition to the current
working memory, there is free memory available into which we can copy the
useful data.  The current working memory consists of vectors whose base
addresses are in registers called <code>the-cars</code> and <code>the-cdrs</code>, and the
free memory is in registers called <code>new-cars</code> and <code>new-cdrs</code>.
</p>
<p>Garbage collection is triggered when we exhaust the free cells in the current
working memory, that is, when a <code>cons</code> operation attempts to increment the
<code>free</code> pointer beyond the end of the memory vector.  When the
garbage-collection process is complete, the <code>root</code> pointer will point into
the new memory, all objects accessible from the <code>root</code> will have been
moved to the new memory, and the <code>free</code> pointer will indicate the next
place in the new memory where a new pair can be allocated.  In addition, the
roles of working memory and new memory will have been interchanged—new pairs
will be constructed in the new memory, beginning at the place indicated by
<code>free</code>, and the (previous) working memory will be available as the new
memory for the next garbage collection.  <a href="#Figure-5_002e15">Figure 5.15</a> shows the
arrangement of memory just before and just after garbage collection.

</figure>

<p>The state of the garbage-collection process is controlled by maintaining two
pointers: <code>free</code> and <code>scan</code>.  These are initialized to point to the
beginning of the new memory.  The algorithm begins by relocating the pair
pointed at by <code>root</code> to the beginning of the new memory.  The pair is
copied, the <code>root</code> pointer is adjusted to point to the new location, and
the <code>free</code> pointer is incremented.  In addition, the old location of the
pair is marked to show that its contents have been moved.  This marking is done
as follows: In the <code>car</code> position, we place a special tag that signals
that this is an already-moved object.  (Such an object is traditionally called
a <a id="index-broken-heart"></a>
<em>broken heart</em>.)<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF302" href="#FOOT302"><sup>302</sup></a>  In the <code>cdr</code> position
we place a <a id="index-forwarding-address"></a>
<em>forwarding address</em> that points at the location to which
the object has been moved.
</p>
<p>After relocating the root, the garbage collector enters its basic cycle.  At
each step in the algorithm, the <code>scan</code> pointer (initially pointing at the
relocated root) points at a pair that has been moved to the new memory but
whose <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> pointers still refer to objects in the old
memory.  These objects are each relocated, and the <code>scan</code> pointer is
incremented.  To relocate an object (for example, the object indicated by the
<code>car</code> pointer of the pair we are scanning) we check to see if the object
has already been moved (as indicated by the presence of a broken-heart tag in
the <code>car</code> position of the object).  If the object has not already been
moved, we copy it to the place indicated by <code>free</code>, update <code>free</code>,
set up a broken heart at the object’s old location, and update the pointer to
the object (in this example, the <code>car</code> pointer of the pair we are
scanning) to point to the new location.  If the object has already been moved,
its forwarding address (found in the <code>cdr</code> position of the broken heart)
is substituted for the pointer in the pair being scanned.  Eventually, all
accessible objects will have been moved and scanned, at which point the
<code>scan</code> pointer will overtake the <code>free</code> pointer and the process will
terminate.
</p>
<p>We can specify the stop-and-copy algorithm as a sequence of instructions for a
register machine.  The basic step of relocating an object is accomplished by a
subroutine called <code>relocate-old-result-in-new</code>.  This subroutine gets its
argument, a pointer to the object to be relocated, from a register named
<code>old</code>.  It relocates the designated object (incrementing <code>free</code> in
the process), puts a pointer to the relocated object into a register called
<code>new</code>, and returns by branching to the entry point stored in the register
<code>relocate-continue</code>.  To begin garbage collection, we invoke this
subroutine to relocate the <code>root</code> pointer, after initializing <code>free</code>
and <code>scan</code>.  When the relocation of <code>root</code> has been accomplished, we
install the new pointer as the new <code>root</code> and enter the main loop of the
garbage collector.

<p>In the main loop of the garbage collector we must determine whether there are
any more objects to be scanned.  We do this by testing whether the <code>scan</code>
pointer is coincident with the <code>free</code> pointer.  If the pointers are equal,
then all accessible objects have been relocated, and we branch to
<code>gc-flip</code>, which cleans things up so that we can continue the interrupted
computation.  If there are still pairs to be scanned, we call the relocate
subroutine to relocate the <code>car</code> of the next pair (by placing the
<code>car</code> pointer in <code>old</code>).  The <code>relocate-continue</code> register is
set up so that the subroutine will return to update the <code>car</code> pointer.

<p>At <code>update-car</code>, we modify the <code>car</code> pointer of the pair being

<code>update-cdr</code> when that relocation has been accomplished.  After relocating
and updating the <code>cdr</code>, we are finished scanning that pair, so we continue

<p>The subroutine <code>relocate-old-result-in-new</code> relocates objects as follows:
If the object to be relocated (pointed at by <code>old</code>) is not a pair, then we
return the same pointer to the object unchanged (in <code>new</code>).  (For example,
we may be scanning a pair whose <code>car</code> is the number 4.  If we represent
the <code>car</code> by <code>n4</code>, as described in <a href="5_002e3_002e1.xhtml#g_t5_002e3_002e1">5.3.1</a>, then we want
the “relocated” <code>car</code> pointer to still be <code>n4</code>.)  Otherwise, we
must perform the relocation.  If the <code>car</code> position of the pair to be
relocated contains a broken-heart tag, then the pair has in fact already been
moved, so we retrieve the forwarding address (from the <code>cdr</code> position of
the broken heart) and return this in <code>new</code>.  If the pointer in <code>old</code>
points at a yet-unmoved pair, then we move the pair to the first free cell in
new memory (pointed at by <code>free</code>) and set up the broken heart by storing a
broken-heart tag and forwarding address at the old location.
<code>Relocate-old-result-in-new</code> uses a register <code>oldcr</code> to hold the
<code>car</code> or the <code>cdr</code> of the object pointed at by
<code>old</code>.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF303" href="#FOOT303"><sup>303</sup></a>

<p>At the very end of the garbage-collection process, we interchange the role of
old and new memories by interchanging pointers: interchanging <code>the-cars</code>
with <code>new-cars</code>, and <code>the-cdrs</code> with <code>new-cdrs</code>.  We will then
be ready to perform another garbage collection the next time memory runs out.

This may not be true eventually, because
memories may get large enough so that it would be impossible to run out of free
memory in the lifetime of the computer.  For example, there are about
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
    <mn>3</mn>
    <mo>⋅<!-- ⋅ --></mo>
    <msup>
      <mn>10</mn>
      <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
        <mn>13</mn>
      </mrow>
    </msup>
  </mrow>
</math> microseconds in a year, so if we were to <code>cons</code> once per
microsecond we would need about <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <msup>
    <mn>10</mn>
    <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">
      <mn>15</mn>
    </mrow>
  </msup>
</math> cells of memory to build a machine that
could operate for 30 years without running out of memory.  That much memory
seems absurdly large by today’s standards, but it is not physically impossible.
On the other hand, processors are getting faster and a future computer may have
large numbers of processors operating in parallel on a single memory, so it may
be possible to use up memory much faster than we have postulated.</p>

We assume here
that the stack is represented as a list as described in <a href="5_002e3_002e1.xhtml#g_t5_002e3_002e1">5.3.1</a>, so
that items on the stack are accessible via the pointer in the stack register.</p>

<div id="FOOT300"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF300"><sup>300</sup></a>
This idea was invented and first implemented by
Minsky, as part of the implementation of Lisp for the PDP-1 at the
<abbr>MIT</abbr> Research Laboratory of Electronics.  It was further developed by
<a href="References.xhtml#Fenichel-and-Yochelson-_00281969_0029">Fenichel and Yochelson (1969)</a> for use in the Lisp implementation for the
Multics time-sharing system.  Later, <a href="References.xhtml#Baker-_00281978_0029">Baker (1978)</a> developed a “real-time”
version of the method, which does not require the computation to stop during
garbage collection.  Baker’s idea was extended by Hewitt, Lieberman, and Moon
(see <a href="References.xhtml#Lieberman-and-Hewitt-1983">Lieberman and Hewitt 1983</a>) to take advantage of the fact that some
structure is more volatile and other structure is more permanent.
</p>
<p>An alternative commonly used garbage-collection technique is the
<a id="index-mark_002dsweep"></a>
<em>mark-sweep</em> method.  This consists of tracing all the structure
accessible from the machine registers and marking each pair we reach.  We then
scan all of memory, and any location that is unmarked is “swept up” as
garbage and made available for reuse.  A full discussion of the mark-sweep
method can be found in <a href="References.xhtml#Allen-1978">Allen 1978</a>.
</p>
<p>The Minsky-Fenichel-Yochelson algorithm is the dominant algorithm in use for
large-memory systems because it examines only the useful part of memory.  This
is in contrast to mark-sweep, in which the sweep phase must check all of
memory.  A second advantage of stop-and-copy is that it is a
<a id="index-compacting"></a>
<em>compacting</em> garbage collector.  That is, at the end of the
garbage-collection phase the useful data will have been moved to consecutive
memory locations, with all garbage pairs compressed out.  This can be an
extremely important performance consideration in machines with virtual memory,
in which accesses to widely separated memory addresses may require extra paging
operations.</p>

This list of registers does not include
the registers used by the storage-allocation system—<code>root</code>,
<code>the-cars</code>, <code>the-cdrs</code>, and the other registers that will be
introduced in this section.</p>

<div id="FOOT302"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF302"><sup>302</sup></a>
The term <em>broken heart</em> was coined by
David Cressey, who wrote a garbage collector for MDL, a dialect of Lisp
developed at <abbr>MIT</abbr> during the early 1970s.</p>

<div id="FOOT303"><p><a class="footnote_backlink" href="#DOCF303"><sup>303</sup></a>
The garbage collector uses the low-level predicate
<code>pointer-to-pair?</code> instead of the list-structure <code>pair?</code>  operation
because in a real system there might be various things that are treated as
pairs for garbage-collection purposes.  For example, in a Scheme system that
conforms to the <abbr>IEEE</abbr> standard a procedure object may be implemented
as a special kind of “pair” that doesn’t satisfy the <code>pair?</code> predicate.
For simulation purposes, <code>pointer-to-pair?</code> can be implemented as
<code>pair?</code>.</p>
