<a id="The-Environment-Model-of-Evaluation"></a>
<h3 class="section"><span class="secnum">3.2</span><span class="sectitle">The Environment Model of Evaluation</span></h3>

<p>When we introduced compound procedures in <a href="Chapter-1.xhtml#Chapter-1">Chapter 1</a>, we used the
substitution model of evaluation (<a href="1_002e1_002e5.xhtml#g_t1_002e1_002e5">1.1.5</a>) to define what is meant
by applying a procedure to arguments:
</p>
<ul>
<li> To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure
with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding argument.

</li></ul>

<p>Once we admit assignment into our programming language, such a definition is no
longer adequate.  In particular, <a href="3_002e1_002e3.xhtml#g_t3_002e1_002e3">3.1.3</a> argued that, in the
presence of assignment, a variable can no longer be considered to be merely a
name for a value.  Rather, a variable must somehow designate a “place” in
which values can be stored.  In our new model of evaluation, these places will
be maintained in structures called <a id="index-environments"></a>
<em>environments</em>.
</p>
<p>An environment is a sequence of <a id="index-frames"></a>
<em>frames</em>.  Each frame is a table
(possibly empty) of <a id="index-bindings"></a>
<em>bindings</em>, which associate variable names with
their corresponding values.  (A single frame may contain at most one binding
for any variable.)  Each frame also has a pointer to its <a id="index-enclosing-environment"></a>
<em>enclosing environment</em>, 
unless, for the purposes of discussion, the frame is considered
to be <a id="index-global-1"></a>
<em>global</em>.  The <a id="index-value-of-a-variable"></a>
<em>value of a variable</em> with respect to an
environment is the value given by the binding of the variable in the first
frame in the environment that contains a binding for that variable.  If no
frame in the sequence specifies a binding for the variable, then the variable
is said to be <a id="index-unbound"></a>
<em>unbound</em> in the environment.
</p>
<p><a href="#Figure-3_002e1">Figure 3.1</a> shows a simple environment structure consisting of three
frames, labeled I, II, and III.  In the diagram, A, B, C, and D are pointers to
environments.  C and D point to the same environment.  The variables <code>z</code>
and <code>x</code> are bound in frame II, while <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> are bound in
frame I.  The value of <code>x</code> in environment D is 3.  The value of <code>x</code>
with respect to environment B is also 3.  This is determined as follows: We
examine the first frame in the sequence (frame III) and do not find a binding
for <code>x</code>, so we proceed to the enclosing environment D and find the binding
in frame I.  On the other hand, the value of <code>x</code> in environment A is 7,
because the first frame in the sequence (frame II) contains a binding of
<code>x</code> to 7.  With respect to environment A, the binding of <code>x</code> to 7 in
frame II is said to <a id="index-shadow"></a>
<em>shadow</em> the binding of <code>x</code> to 3 in frame I.

<p>The environment is crucial to the evaluation process, because it determines the
context in which an expression should be evaluated.  Indeed, one could say that
expressions in a programming language do not, in themselves, have any meaning.
Rather, an expression acquires a meaning only with respect to some environment
in which it is evaluated.  Even the interpretation of an expression as
straightforward as <code>(+ 1 1)</code> depends on an understanding that one is
operating in a context in which <code>+</code> is the symbol for addition.  Thus, in
our model of evaluation we will always speak of evaluating an expression with
respect to some environment.  To describe interactions with the interpreter, we
will suppose that there is a global environment, consisting of a single frame
(with no enclosing environment) that includes values for the symbols associated
with the primitive procedures.  For example, the idea that <code>+</code> is the
symbol for addition is captured by saying that the symbol <code>+</code> is bound in
the global environment to the primitive addition procedure.
