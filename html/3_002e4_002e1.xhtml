<h4 class="subsection"><span class="secnum">3.4.1</span><span class="sectitle">The Nature of Time in Concurrent Systems</span></h4>

<p>On the surface, time seems straightforward.  It is an ordering imposed on
events.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF163" href="#FOOT163"><sup>163</sup></a>  For any events <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>A</mi>
</math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>B</mi>
</math>, either <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>A</mi>
</math> occurs before <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>B</mi>
</math>,
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>A</mi>
</math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>B</mi>
</math> are simultaneous, or <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>A</mi>
</math> occurs after <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>B</mi>
</math>.  For instance,
returning to the bank account example, suppose that Peter withdraws $10 and
Paul withdraws $25 from a joint account that initially contains $100, leaving
$65 in the account.  Depending on the order of the two withdrawals, the
sequence of balances in the account is either $100 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mo stretchy="false">→<!-- → --></mo>
</math> $90 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mo stretchy="false">→<!-- → --></mo>
</math> $65 or $100 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mo stretchy="false">→<!-- → --></mo>
</math> $75
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mo stretchy="false">→<!-- → --></mo>
</math> $65.  In a computer implementation of the banking system, this changing
sequence of balances could be modeled by successive assignments to a variable
<code>balance</code>.
</p>
<p>In complex situations, however, such a view can be problematic.  Suppose that
Peter and Paul, and other people besides, are accessing the same bank account
through a network of banking machines distributed all over the world.  The
actual sequence of balances in the account will depend critically on the
detailed timing of the accesses and the details of the communication among the
machines.
</p>
<p>This indeterminacy in the order of events can pose serious problems in the
design of concurrent systems.  For instance, suppose that the withdrawals made
by Peter and Paul are implemented as two separate processes sharing a common
variable <code>balance</code>, each process specified by the procedure given in
<a href="3_002e1_002e1.xhtml#g_t3_002e1_002e1">3.1.1</a>:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">define</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pln">withdraw amount</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">
  </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">if</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pun">&gt;=</span><span class="pln"> balance amount</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">
      </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">begin</span><span class="pln"> 
        </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">set</span><span class="pun">!</span><span class="pln"> balance 
              </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln"> balance amount</span><span class="clo">))</span><span class="pln">
        balance</span><span class="clo">)</span><span class="pln">
      </span><span class="str">"Insufficient funds"</span><span class="clo">))</span></pre></div>

<p>If the two processes operate independently, then Peter might test the
balance and attempt to withdraw a legitimate amount.  However, Paul
might withdraw some funds in between the time that Peter checks the
balance and the time Peter completes the withdrawal, thus invalidating
Peter’s test.
</p>
<p>Things can be worse still.  Consider the expression
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp prettyprinted" style=""><span class="opn">(</span><span class="kwd">set</span><span class="pun">!</span><span class="pln"> balance </span><span class="opn">(</span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln"> balance amount</span><span class="clo">))</span></pre></div>

<p>executed as part of each withdrawal process.  This consists of three steps: (1)
accessing the value of the <code>balance</code> variable; (2) computing the new
balance; (3) setting <code>balance</code> to this new value.  If Peter and Paul’s
withdrawals execute this statement concurrently, then the two withdrawals might
interleave the order in which they access <code>balance</code> and set it to the new
value.
</p>
<p>The timing diagram in <a href="#Figure-3_002e29">Figure 3.29</a> depicts an order of events where
<code>balance</code> starts at 100, Peter withdraws 10, Paul withdraws 25, and yet
the final value of <code>balance</code> is 75.  As shown in the diagram, the reason
for this anomaly is that Paul’s assignment of 75 to <code>balance</code> is made
under the assumption that the value of <code>balance</code> to be decremented is 100.
That assumption, however, became invalid when Peter changed <code>balance</code> to
90.  This is a catastrophic failure for the banking system, because the total
amount of money in the system is not conserved.  Before the transactions, the
total amount of money was $100.  Afterwards, Peter has $10, Paul has $25, and
the bank has $75.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF164" href="#FOOT164"><sup>164</sup></a>

<p>The general phenomenon illustrated here is that several processes may share a
common state variable.  What makes this complicated is that more than one
process may be trying to manipulate the shared state at the same time.  For the
bank account example, during each transaction, each customer should be able to
act as if the other customers did not exist.  When a customer changes the
balance in a way that depends on the balance, he must be able to assume that,
just before the moment of change, the balance is still what he thought it was.
</p>
<a id="Correct-behavior-of-concurrent-programs"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Correct behavior of concurrent programs</h5>

<p>The above example typifies the subtle bugs that can creep into concurrent
programs.  The root of this complexity lies in the assignments to variables
that are shared among the different processes.  We already know that we must be
careful in writing programs that use <code>set!</code>, because the results of a
computation depend on the order in which the assignments occur.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF165" href="#FOOT165"><sup>165</sup></a>  With concurrent processes we must be especially careful
about assignments, because we may not be able to control the order of the
assignments made by the different processes.  If several such changes might be
made concurrently (as with two depositors accessing a joint account) we need
some way to ensure that our system behaves correctly.  For example, in the case
of withdrawals from a joint bank account, we must ensure that money is
conserved.  To make concurrent programs behave correctly, we may have to place
some restrictions on concurrent execution.
</p>
<p>One possible restriction on concurrency would stipulate that no two operations
that change any shared state variables can occur at the same time.  This is an
extremely stringent requirement.  For distributed banking, it would require the
system designer to ensure that only one transaction could proceed at a time.
This would be both inefficient and overly conservative.  <a href="#Figure-3_002e30">Figure 3.30</a>
shows Peter and Paul sharing a bank account, where Paul has a private account
as well.  The diagram illustrates two withdrawals from the shared account (one
by Peter and one by Paul) and a deposit to Paul’s private account.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF166" href="#FOOT166"><sup>166</sup></a>  The two withdrawals from the
shared account must not be concurrent (since both access and update the same
account), and Paul’s deposit and withdrawal must not be concurrent (since both
access and update the amount in Paul’s wallet).  But there should be no problem
permitting Paul’s deposit to his private account to proceed concurrently with
Peter’s withdrawal from the shared account.

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A less stringent restriction on concurrency would ensure that a concurrent
system produces the same result as if the processes had run sequentially in
some order.  There are two important aspects to this requirement.  First, it
does not require the processes to actually run sequentially, but only to
produce results that are the same <em>as if</em> they had run sequentially.  For
the example in <a href="#Figure-3_002e30">Figure 3.30</a>, the designer of the bank account system can
safely allow Paul’s deposit and Peter’s withdrawal to happen concurrently,
because the net result will be the same as if the two operations had happened
sequentially.  Second, there may be more than one possible “correct” result
produced by a concurrent program, because we require only that the result be
the same as for <em>some</em> sequential order.  For example, suppose that Peter
and Paul’s joint account starts out with $100, and Peter deposits $40 while
Paul concurrently withdraws half the money in the account.  Then sequential
execution could result in the account balance being either $70 or $90 (see
<a href="#Exercise-3_002e38">Exercise 3.38</a>).<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF167" href="#FOOT167"><sup>167</sup></a>
</p>
<p>There are still weaker requirements for correct execution of concurrent
programs.  A program for simulating diffusion (say, the flow of heat in an
object) might consist of a large number of processes, each one representing a
small volume of space, that update their values concurrently.  Each process
repeatedly changes its value to the average of its own value and its neighbors’
values.  This algorithm converges to the right answer independent of the order
in which the operations are done; there is no need for any restrictions on
concurrent use of the shared values.

<p><strong><a id="Exercise-3_002e38"></a>Exercise 3.38:</strong> Suppose that Peter, Paul, and
Mary share a joint bank account that initially contains $100.  Concurrently,
Peter deposits $10, Paul withdraws $20, and Mary withdraws half the money in
the account, by executing the following commands:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Peter: (set! balance (+ balance 10))

An even worse failure for this system could occur if
the two <code>set!</code> operations attempt to change the balance simultaneously, in
which case the actual data appearing in memory might end up being a random
combination of the information being written by the two processes.  Most
computers have interlocks on the primitive memory-write operations, which
protect against such simultaneous access.  Even this seemingly simple kind of
protection, however, raises implementation challenges in the design of
multiprocessing computers, where elaborate <a id="index-cache_002dcoherence"></a>
<em>cache-coherence</em> protocols
are required to ensure that the various processors will maintain a consistent
view of memory contents, despite the fact that data may be replicated
